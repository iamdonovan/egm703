    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In the lectures and reading this week, you've learned about hyperspectral remote sensing and a number of different methods for analyzing hyperspectral data. In this practical, we'll gain some experience working with hyperspectral data, using a few examples written in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open and view data using xarray\n",
    "- Perform atmospheric correction using dark object subtraction\n",
    "- Use spectral angle matching to compare spectral signatures and identify surfaces\n",
    "- Gain some familiarity with Spectral Python (SPy), a python package for analyzing hyperspectral images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data provided\n",
    "In the `data` folder, you should have the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- solar_spectra.csv\n",
    "- spectral_library.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to download the hyperspectral data from Blackboard, or from the Google Drive link [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18EHJpSbkbARJ2Rt6NndBSPe9SlcYr_iO/view?usp=sharing) - be sure to save it to the `data` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1 Getting started\n",
    "As always, we need to run the following cell to import the necessary libraries, as well as define a couple of functions that we'll use for displaying the image(s)."
